Would love to see more of Bitim and Sanogo tonight. Craig and Carter are for sure great additions, but I think those two have a lot of potential in this roster and I'm interested to see more.

Windy City Bulls vs Grand Rapids Gold!

How is it fair that we have to play Denver multiple times in the preseason? If we don’t make the preseason playoffs it’s going to be because the schedule makers fuked us.

It’s good because that means we’ll have more film for when we play them in the finals.

Exciting preseason!
